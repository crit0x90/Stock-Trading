# Stock-Trading
The purpose of this program is to simulate two client users
trading stocks with a server

All of the instructions provided in the following readme
are based on the assumption that all of the required 
directories and files are in their correct place

To execute this program python 3.5 should be used and both
the server and the clients are to be run on linux machines.
If these conditions are not met then the program cannot be
guaranteed to work.

To execute this program first run 'python3 server.py'
(it may be necessary to change the port number, but 
this is unlikely)

Then run 'python3 client.py' and 'python3 client2.py'
if the IP address is needed for the server run 'ifconfig'
before attempting to run the server. 

All of the details on how the program executes are contained
in the report.
